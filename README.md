# CSS-TidyTuesday
Code for Science &amp; Society TidyTuesday Data Viz Accessibility event

## Data Viz Accessibility Education Event for the #TidyTuesday Twitter Learning Community

The [MiR Community](https://mircommunity.com/about/) seeks to promote the visibility and leadership of R users from marginalized races, genders, and the disabled community through community-led efforts that support professional development. This week-long [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) event hosted by the MiR Community aims to enhance the accessibility of shared visualizations for a wider audience, and increase awareness among data visualization creators of the benefits of these practices using modern tools available within the R programming ecosystem. The event will teach and promote a variety of accessibility practices that can be implemented in the design, creation, and sharing of data visualizations so that data-driven insights can be communicated as inclusively and effectively as possible.

Financially supported by a $10,000 grant from the [Code for Science & Society virtual event fund](https://eventfund.codeforscience.org/announcing-the-new-cohort-of-event-fund-grantees/)

## Project idea
* We saw a tweet from data viz consultant Rebeca Pop about how to make charts more accessible and thought it would be nice to build these tips and others into the weekly R [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data visualization social project. As examples, tips from Rebeca included:
  * Use white space wisely
  * Label data directly
  * Use alternative text
* The idea was [proposed on Twitter to Tom Mock](https://twitter.com/spcanelon/status/1328503523797999616?s=20), who manages TidyTuesday, and he expressed a desire to collaborate on it with the MiR Community. 

## Motivation
* Most TidyTuesday visualizations are not accessible to many members of the R community
* R users that participate in TidyTuesday would benefit in learning about the why and how to create accessible data visualizations
* Education could be provided to TidyTuesday participants in the form of bite-sized accessibility tips/guidelines
* Encouraging TidyTuesday participants to practice implementing accessibility practices in their data viz could be a way to both help more people access them and help the data viz creators feel more confident in using these skills in future TidyTuesdays as well as in other places
* The MiR Community accessibility committee (Dorris Scott, Danielle Smalls-Perkins, and Liz Hare) had already begun working on accessibility guidelines for the R community in other contexts

## Outline
* The MiR Community will host one TidyTuesday week in 2022 with a specific accessibility focus
* The goal will be to teach participants how to implement a few accessibility practices (to be determined) in their data viz that week
* Participants will be encouraged to tweet out which practice(s) they implemented along with their data viz and hopefully cause a little ripple effect of accessibility education. MiR project organizers could potentially help by retweeting some examples
* MiR will provide educational materials which could include a short video made available on YouTube as well as a blog post. Everything formatted to be accessible, of course.
* This project will continue to be carried out by MiR with ongoing and evolving education and conversations about accessibility in the R community. The idea is to keep the conversation going beyond TidyTuesday and beyond data viz.
