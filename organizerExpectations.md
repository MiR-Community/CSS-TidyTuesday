# Organizer expections

All organizers will be expected to do the following:

## Show Up

* Attend project meetings or inform other members of the organizing team if they will not be able to attend. Please see project timeline.
* Perform duties outlined in the following role description:
	* Coordinate with the #TidyTuesday team (i.e. Tom Mock) to prepare a TidyTuesday README
	* Prepare tweets for each module on each day
	* Project planning, preparing, and management
	* Retweet participants' submissions (you do not need to have a personal Twitter account)
	* Monitor the MiR Twitter account for any Code of Conduct violations, and report them to tidytuesdaya11y@mircommunity.com
	* Internally review all education materials and event content for set accessibility standards
	* Meet with the educators and provide support when they have questions or encounter difficulties. We are thinking that each organizer will have dedicated office hours every other week when they are available on Discord.
	* Prepare the tweet content that will be shared each day of TidyTuesday. Each day, the tweet (or thread) will include information relevant to that day and the proyect overall
	* Add the educational content to the [MiR Community website](https://mircommunity.com/), one day at a time. The educators will create the content and the organizers will upload the content to the website when it's time.
	* "Close" the TidyTuesday event on the last day, giving thanks to everyone who participated and provided support, etc.
